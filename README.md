My personal blog. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Inspired by [Dan Abramov's overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/). Syntax theme is [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/).

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
